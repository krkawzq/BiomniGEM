# Reasoning-Distill

**Reasoning-Distill** is an asymmetric information–based annotation framework designed to generate and refine **Chain-of-Thought (CoT)** reasoning traces automatically.  
Instead of relying on an external teacher model, it performs **self-distillation** — extracting and improving reasoning paths from the model itself.

## Overview

Reasoning-Distill operates in four main stages:

1. **Guided Generation**  
   The model receives a partial context or the correct answer and produces a reasoning trace explaining *why* or *how* the answer holds.

2. **Reverse Verification**  
   The reasoning trace (without the answer) is fed back to the model, which must infer the answer solely from the reasoning chain.

3. **Rejection Sampling**  
   The predicted answer is compared with the ground truth.  
   - If consistent → marked as a **positive CoT sample**  
   - If inconsistent → marked as a **negative sample**  

4. **Iterative Refinement**  
   Positive and negative samples are used together in subsequent fine-tuning or reinforcement learning steps to improve reasoning quality.

## Key Features

- **Asymmetric Supervision** — leverages unbalanced information (answer-only or reasoning-only) to stimulate logical inference.  
- **Self-Distillation** — improves reasoning without external teacher models.  
- **Contrastive CoT Training** — uses both correct and incorrect reasoning traces to stabilize learning.  
- **Reusable Framework** — applicable beyond biology for any domain requiring structured reasoning.
